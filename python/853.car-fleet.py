# Testcase Example:  '12\n[10,8,0,5,3]\n[2,4,1,1,3]'
#
# There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The
# destination is target miles away.
# 
# You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where
# position[i] is the position of the i^th car and speed[i] is the speed of the
# i^th car (in miles per hour).
# 
# A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to itÂ and
# drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to
# match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored
# (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).
# 
# A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and
# same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.
# 
# If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will
# still be considered as one car fleet.
# 
# Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting
# each other at 12.
# The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by
# itself.
# The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each
# other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
# Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the
# answer is 3.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each
# other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.
# Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one
# fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches
# target.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == position.length == speed.length
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
# 0 < target <= 10^6
# 0 <= position[i] < target
# All the values of position are unique.
# 0 < speed[i] <= 10^6
#
